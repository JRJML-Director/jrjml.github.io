[< Table of Contents][0]

#### Registration and Borrowing Regulations
1. Any Virginia resident is entitled to free library services and may apply for a library card in person at the J. Robert Jamerson Memorial Library of Appomattox, Virginia.

2. Upon application for a library card, an applicant is required to show two forms of identification. 

3. Patrons may check out three books and one video on the day of registration. Once the patron has returned the initial materials, he or she will hold full library priveleges.

4. The library card issued in the patron's name should be presented when borrowing items from the Library. To check out library materials without showing a library card, the patron must present proper identification. A patron is allowed to show a non-library form of identification once without having their library card with them. On the second time the patron cannot present a library card, a new card must be made in order for materials to be checked out. The replacement cost of a lost or misplaced card is $1.00.
