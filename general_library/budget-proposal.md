[< Table of Contents][0]

The Libary Director must prepare and submitt a budget proposal to County Administration annually by January outlining expected expenditure for the upcoming year. In order to recieve important State Aid grants the Library must satisfy all [State Aid Requirements][1]. Particular attention must be paid to Requirement 3. To this end, the Director must ensure to account for any increase or decrease in upcoming State Aid which are published annually on the [Extranet][2]. For example, when applying for "level-funding", the Library must actually ask for more or less money than the previous year due to annual fluxuations in State Aid to ensure compliance with State Aid Requirements. Failure to comply with these requirements could easily result in the Library losing State Aid.
