### 14.1 Long Range Plan
[< Table of Contents][0]

#### Forward

The Appomattox County Library has been serving the community of Appomattox, Virginia since our very first public Library began in 1936. The growing collection of nearly five-thousand books was moved in 1940 into a space which would be large enough to house it. By 1992, a half-century later, that collection had quadrupled in size and the Library was, finally, moved into its current home on 157 Main Street as the J. Robert Jamerson Memorial Library.

The Library's collection is still growing and includes paperbacks, hardbacks, audio discs, video discs, newspapers, magazines, e-books, and sixteen public internet terminals and two public catalog terminals. We offer affordable document printing, copying, scanning, and fax from a single public all-in-one terminal and two public scanning terminals. The Library's collection is maintained by a Commonwealth of Virginia Certified Librarian, two full-time staff, and two to four part-time staff. Using an open-source Library Management System, we are able to provide all these services to thousands of patrons locally and throughout the Commonwealth.

In the next five years we aim to enhance our existing community services including digital literacy, early literacy, and cultural awareness. We will also seek to establish new resource avenues and provide patrons with the highest standard of resources to meet their every information need.
