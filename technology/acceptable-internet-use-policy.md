### 8.2 Acceptable Internet Use Policy
[< Table of Contents][0]

#### Introduction

The mission of the J. Robert Jamerson Memorial Library is to provide for the informational, educational, and recreational needs of Appomattox County residents. In keeping with this mission, the Library provides public access to computers and the Internet, which offers current global resources to meet these needs.

The J. Robert Jamerson Library does not control the information available on the Internet and cannot be held responsible for its content. The Internet takes patrons outside Library walls and into an electronic world of information, which has all the excitements and risks of the world at large. Much of the information may be valuable, but not all Internet resources are reliable, current, or accurate. Patrons may find opinions, ideas, and images, which are controversial, divergent, inflammatory, and offensive. By providing access, the Library does not endorse or sanction the content or point of view of information or commentary found on the Internet. Patrons are encouraged to be critical consumers and to evaluate information carefully.

Library staff will assist patrons in accessing the internet and will provide pointers to resources which have been judged to be reliable. However, each user is responsible for his or her own search. Staff cannot provide in-depth personal training in the use of the Internet or of personal computers. 

The Internet is a global network of thousands of smaller computer networks. The use of standardized rules, or protocols, which make it possible for different computers to communicate with each other, allows for sharing of information among these networks.

#### Access and Use

To use the computers at the J. Robert Jamerson Memorial Library, patrons must sign-in at the circulation desk.
