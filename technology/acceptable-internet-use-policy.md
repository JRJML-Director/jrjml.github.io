#### Introduction

The mission of the J. Robert Jamerson Memorial Library is to provide for the informational, educational, and recreational needs of Appomattox County residents. In keeping with this mission, the Library provides public access to computers and the Internet, which offers current global resources to meet these needs.

The J. Robert Jamerson Library does not control the information available on the Internet and cannot be held responsible for its content. The Internet takes patrons outside Library walls and into an electronic world of information, which has all the excitements and risks of the world at large.
